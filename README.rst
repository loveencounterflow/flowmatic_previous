WTF?

Like SillyPutty, but not as brittle. Like Perl, but less cryptic. Like Python, but sans the Batteries, and less braces. Or, like, braces all over the place, if it's that what you want. Like CoffeeScript, but with a sound dose of identity crisis. Like Brainfuck, but completely different. An exploratorium for programming language lovers. Touch it the right way, and enjoy the purr. Touch it the wrong way and watch as it bites back and crashes. Awesome.

FTW!

So i was looking for a language and, Lo!, there was JavaScript, back in 1999. After dealing with one linguistic atrocity too much, however, i was quick to dump it, having discovered Python, which—after Basic, Assembler, Forth, VisualBasic, C (i believe i did manage to print out 'Helo World' back then, but not sure), Java (still traumatized by that one), and Perl—seemed like a *sane* thing to do.

So i spent the decade of 2k00 mainly with writing Python; many of my efforts
