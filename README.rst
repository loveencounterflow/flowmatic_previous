WTF?

Like SillyPutty, but not as brittle. Like Perl, but less cryptic. Like Python, but sans the Batteries, and less braces. Or, like, braces all over the place, if it's that what you want. Like CoffeeScript, but with a sound dose of identity crisis. Like Brainfuck, but completely different. An exploratorium for programming language lovers. Touch it the right way and enjoy the purr. Touch it the wrong way and watch it bitching and crashing. Awesome.


FTW!

So i was looking for my next favorite programming language in 1999 and, Lo!, there was JavaScript. After dealing with one linguistic atrocity too much, however, i was quick to dump it, having just discovered Python (then the new, slash, kewl kid on the block), which—after Basic, Assembler, Forth, VisualBasic, C (never got beyond 'Helo World', tho), Java (still traumatized by that one), and **$#%** Perl—seemed like a *sane* thing to do for a change.

I spent the decade of 2k00 writing my programs in Python—quite to the exclusion of other options, while still hunting the mythical next beast. I immediately fell in love with significant whitespace and dived into classical object-oriented programming (which, be it said, is better done and easier to grasp in Python than in *any* other language i'm aware of). I pulled off *all* the pranks you can pull off in Python and OOP (like, multiple inheritance, decorators, factories, metaclasses, deep magic, and i even touched the gory innards of ``import``—yuck) only to find out that most of this stuff is about as useful as a talking toaster when you're out bungee jumping without the rope—You don't. Need. Any. Of. This.
